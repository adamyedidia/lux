This work draws inspiration from past work from two broad categories: the first is non-line-of-sight imaging, particularly occlusion-aided non-light-of-sight imaging, and the second is past work in blind deconvolution. To our knowledge, this work is the first to synthesize these two well-studied areas of research into an algorithm that does something novel: get a two-dimensional view of a hidden scene, with only minimal assumptions about the hidden scene and unknown occluder.
