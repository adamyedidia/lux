This work is the first, to our knowledge, to study blind, fully uncalibrated non-line-of-sight imaging in the passive setting and produce experimental results. We believe that many of the most practical NLoS systems of the future will be uncalibrated, as in a wide variety of settings, most notably automatic driving systems in traffic, one cannot rely on having detailed preknowledge of the surrounding environment. Real-world scenes are constantly changing; we believe that work on NLoS systems should reflect that reality.

There is still an enormous amount of room for improvement. First and most obviously, our occluder-recovery algorithm is unlikely to be optimal. A lot of work went into fine-tuning it before it achieved results even as good as the ones presented in this paper, and it's very probable that the algorithm can be substantially improved, perhaps by incorporating ideas
