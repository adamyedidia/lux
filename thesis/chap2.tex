\section{The Mutual Information Model of IF Optimality}

Throughout this thesis, a recurring theme is that we'd like to be able to measure how useful an occluder (or other intermediate frame) is to do imaging with. The simplest way to do this is to measure the mutual information between the scene and the observation plane, given a particular transfer matrix (which describes how the intermediate frame transforms the scene before it reaches the observation plane) and signal-to-noise ratio.

\subsection{The Scene Model}

For the time being, we will consider a 2D ``flatland'' model of the world for simplicity. Extensions to the 3D world are simple, and as previously explained, the 2D model is still representative of the real world in that it accurately describes what happens when you integrate over one the two spatial dimensions in your observation.



\subsection{The Noise Model}

Let's assume that the amount of noise
